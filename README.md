Chioni's Climb

///Story So Far///

When Chioni's gramdother passed away, she took the old ways with her.  Now, Chioni's tribe has lost it's way, and she doesn't know what to do.  Recalling Nana's stories by the fire, Chioni recalls an old favorite, that described speaking to the spirits of the dead and the Gods from the top of Paget√≥nas, the great glacier.  Determined to restore the heart of her tibe, she takes trusty grapple and piton and prepares to tackle Pagetonas and seek guidance from the past.
